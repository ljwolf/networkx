=====
Delaunay graphs from geographic points
=====

This example shows how to build a delaunay graph (plus its dual,
the set of Voronoi polygons) from a set of points.
For this, we will use the set of cholera cases at the Broad Street Pump, 
recorded by John Snow in 1853. The methods shown here can also work 
directly with polygonal data using their centroids as representative points.
