=====
Graphs from geographic points
=====

This example shows how to build a graph from a set of points
using PySAL and geopandas. In this example, we'll use the famous
set of cholera cases at the Broad Street Pump, recorded by John Snow in 1853.
The methods shown here can also work directly with polygonal data using their
centroids as representative points.
